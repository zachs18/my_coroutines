# idea:
#  we can assume that any things that are necessary to enter a function are already true, since we just entered co_yield
#  e.g. we don't have to deal with "The CPU shall be in x87 mode upon entry to a function." (x86-64-psABI-1.0.pdf section 3.2.1) and the like
#       we also don't have to handle the calling function's red-zone
#
# on call:
# set up stack frame
# push all callee-saved registers to our stack (rbx, r12-r15)
# pull our execution info from linked list
# restore other's execution info from linked list
# jump to other's ip (leaving yielded value in %rdi)
#
# on resume:
# move passed value to %rax
# restore saved registers
# clean stack
# return
